# NAIC
NAIC or Not Another Instagram Clone is a project from [Inchoo PHP Academy 2016](https://github.com/Inchoo/php-academy). In this web application the admin has the ability to post his photos on the server and he can chose if the photos will be public or private. The admin can see both public and private photos but if an person comes on this web application he can only see the public photos. 

##TO DO LIST
This is still a work in progres. There are stil few things that should be done:
* make paging for the gallery
* make admin session
* function to delete photos
* function to view photos in bigger size
* function for searching photos by their name
* user interface

##How to use
Public gallery is the index page. For the admin part you have to use _/login_ url which will lead to login page. **Username** and **password** are both **admin**. After login you will be transfered to the admin library where you can see public and private photos and you can upload new ones by clicking on _Upload_ button. Logout and search currently **don't** work.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
